# iDIG — Signal-Driven Discovery Framework

> **Status: Active Development (Public Framework Overview)**

## Overview

**iDIG** is a signal-driven discovery framework designed to help people make sense of complex information *before* making decisions.

Instead of ranking results, enforcing rigid filters, or optimizing for clicks, iDIG focuses on **alignment**—bringing together **intent**, **context**, and **incoming signals** so that relevance emerges naturally.

At its core, iDIG treats discovery as a **coherence problem**, not a search problem.

---

## The Problem iDIG Addresses

Most modern discovery systems are built on assumptions that no longer hold:

- That relevance can be universally ranked  
- That more data leads to better decisions  
- That speed equals understanding  
- That algorithms should decide *for* the user  

These systems often collapse nuance, hide context, and optimize for engagement rather than clarity—leaving people overwhelmed, misaligned, or nudged toward outcomes they didn’t intend.

iDIG was created as an alternative.

## What iDIG Is

iDIG is a **signal-conditioning and context-enrichment framework** that helps observers:

- Define **what they are trying to do** (project intent)
- Declare **who they are and how they see** (observer perspective)
- Ingest signals from multiple sources (APIs, documents, feeds, uploads)
- See **what aligns**, **what conflicts**, and **what doesn’t belong**

Rather than forcing binary yes/no matches, iDIG allows signals to **attract**, **repel**, or remain contextual—so understanding forms *before* judgment.

## Core Principles

### Observer-Conditioned Discovery
There is no “neutral” discovery. Every result is shaped by perspective.  
iDIG makes that perspective explicit and adjustable.

### Coherence Over Ranking
iDIG does not sort the world into winners and losers.  
It surfaces patterns of alignment and misalignment.

### Context Is First-Class
Signals are meaningless without context.  
iDIG treats context as something that must be defined, preserved, and respected.

### Human-in-the-Loop by Design
The user is never replaced by the system.  
iDIG supports interpretation instead of automating conclusions.

## What Makes iDIG Different

| Traditional Systems | iDIG |
|--------------------|------|
| Ranking & scoring | Coherence & alignment |
| Hard filters | Attract / Repel / Context |
| Black-box optimization | Transparent signal logic |
| Engagement-driven | Intent-driven |
| Algorithm decides | Observer tunes |

---

## Where iDIG Is Used

The framework is intentionally domain-agnostic and has been applied to:

- Recruiting & hiring alignment  
- Contractor and consultant discovery  
- M&A and business research  
- Government and federal opportunity analysis  
- Knowledge curation and deep inquiry  
- Context-aware summarization and sense-making  

Anywhere decisions depend on *fit*, *trust*, and *meaning*—not just keywords—iDIG fits.

## What This Repository Represents

This repository documents the **public framework** behind iDIG:

- Conceptual architecture  
- Signal models  
- Observer and project context structures  
- Design philosophy and patterns  

It is intended for builders, researchers, and practitioners interested in alternative discovery systems—not as a drop-in product, but as a way of thinking and building.

---

## Development Status

iDIG is evolving rapidly.  
Interfaces, terminology, and internal mechanisms may change as the framework matures.

This repository prioritizes:
- Conceptual clarity over implementation completeness  
- Transparency of intent over optimization  
- Exploration over premature standardization  

---

## Philosophy

iDIG is built on a simple belief:

> **Understanding should emerge before judgment.**

In a world optimized for speed and certainty, iDIG slows discovery just enough to let meaning form—without taking agency away from the human doing the observing.
